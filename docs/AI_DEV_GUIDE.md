ðŸŽ¯ Track Royale â€“ AI Dev Brief
Goal:
Build Track Royale, a cross-platform, multiplayer, mobile sports game inspired by the track & field genre. It will have competitive real-time matches, player rankings, clubs, and social features similar to Clash Royale, but with a sports theme.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Game Engine: Unity (latest LTS version)

Language: C#

Platforms: iOS + Android (single Unity project)

Multiplayer: Photon Fusion or Photon PUN (low-latency real-time multiplayer)

Backend Services:

PlayFab (authentication, leaderboards, cloud save, player data)

Photon (matchmaking, networking)

UI Library: Unity UI Toolkit or standard Canvas UI (TextMeshPro for text)

ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
Assets/Scripts â†’ All C# scripts

Assets/Scenes â†’ Unity scenes

Assets/Prefabs â†’ Prefabricated game objects

Assets/Art â†’ Sprites, animations

Assets/UI â†’ UI prefabs and layouts

.gitignore â†’ Based on Unityâ€™s official template

ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay
Players compete in short, skill-based track & field events (100m sprint, hurdles, javelin, long jump, shot put, etc.).

Events are real-time multiplayer with quick matchmaking.

Players earn points/trophies to move up leagues.

Match rewards: coins, cosmetics, player upgrades (non-pay-to-win).

Clubs (similar to Clash Royale clans)

Friend system (invite, challenge)

Seasonal leaderboards

Player profiles & stats

Friends list & private matches

Seasonal resets

Phase 4 â€“ Monetization & Polish

UI/UX polish & animations

Sound effects & music

App Store / Google Play submission

ðŸ“‹ AI Usage Rules
When generating or modifying code:

Match Unity C# conventions â€” use PascalCase for public fields, camelCase for private.

Keep multiplayer in mind â€” all gameplay logic should be syncable via Photon.

Use coroutines for timed events â€” avoid blocking calls.

Separate logic from UI â€” gameplay scripts shouldnâ€™t hardcode UI updates.

Document with XML comments so other devs (and AI) can read them.
